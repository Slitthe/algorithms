1. Download and install Docker Desktop for your operating system
2. Run the following command in this directory:
    docker build -t product-except-itself-ts . && docker run --rm product-except-itself-ts && docker rmi
product-except-itself-ts

This command will build a container in which to run the file, then immediately execute it,
and afterwards it also deletes so that it won't occupy your disk space
